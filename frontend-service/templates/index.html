**Defining the Task Scope**

I'm now focused on precisely what's needed. First, I have to rebuild the `index.html` file. Then, I have to use the resume document as the core data source, which is already stored in context. I have been able to define all the core inputs.


**Structuring HTML Elements**

I'm outlining the `index.html` structure now, beginning with a `<body>` element. I'll map each resume section to HTML elements, ensuring the layout is semantic. This involves headings for each section (e.g., `<h2>` for "Experience") and appropriate tags for content, and making the "Projects" section dynamic.


**Mapping Resume to HTML**

I'm working through the resume section by section now, ensuring each gets a dedicated HTML element. The "Experience" section is a key focus; I'm planning nested elements: a `<section>`, a `<h2>` for the heading, and then `<article>` elements for each job, including headings, dates, and bullet points. I'm making sure the static content from the resume merges nicely with the dynamic content for the "Projects" section, which will also reside inside the `main` tag.


**Mapping Remaining Resume Sections**

I'm now focused on structuring the remaining sections. I'll follow a consistent pattern: `<section>` tags with appropriate `<h2>` headings. I'm planning separate sections for skills (nested `div` elements for categories), certifications, and achievements. The structure should be clean. I need to remember the `div`s for the skills section and use a similar layout for each.


**Detailing Header and Main**

I'm focusing on the initial HTML structure. The `<header>` will contain the name, title, and contact details, which I'll extract from the resume's OCR text and render. The `<main>` section will then house the remaining sections: overview, experience, skills, and so on.


**Detailing the Experience Section**

I'm now breaking down the "Experience" section in detail. This is where most of the static data from the resume needs to be integrated. I am planning to use `<article>` elements, each representing a job, with nested elements to clearly display the title, company, dates, and responsibilities, each in a bulleted list.


**Planning HTML Structure**

I'm now focusing on the HTML structure. I'm creating a well-defined outline, with a `<body>`, `<header>`, and `<main>` section containing appropriate tags for each resume element. This includes sections for experience, skills, and achievements.


Of course. Here is a complete, production-ready `index.html` file that translates every section of Himanshu Tiwary's resume into a structured and well-formatted webpage.

This version keeps the **dynamic project showcase** section you built, which fetches data from your backend API, and adds all the other resume sections (Experience, Skills, Certifications, etc.) as static HTML content. This creates a comprehensive and professional portfolio page.

Simply replace the entire contents of your `frontend-service/templates/index.html` file with the code below.
